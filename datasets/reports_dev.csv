MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
""""L. upper lobe core Bx x 2 cores"""". Two tan core biopsies 10 and 15mm. A2. (mk/gk). 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Sections show two cores of lung parenchyma. There is patchy involvement of the lung parenchyma with areas of relatively uninvolved lung parenchyma interspersed with areas containing lesional material. In the areas of involved lung, the interstitium appears expanded by collections of epithelioid histiocytes/multinucleated giant cells and poorly formed granulomata. There is associated fibrin deposition with a protrusion of these plugs into the alveolar spaces. There are rounded spherical, some ovoid yeast forms with surrounding clear spaces within the cytoplasm of the histiocytes/multinucleated giant cells. The yeast forms vary in size. There is a background infiltrate comprising small lymphocytes, eosinophils. Plasma cells are inconspicuous. Collections of neutrophils are not seen. There is no vasculitis, areas of geographic necrosis or associated vascular proliferation. 

The yeast forms are highlighted with D/PAS and Grocott Methanamine Silver stains. On the Alcian Blue stain, a small proportion of the yeast forms show staining confined to the outer rim of the cell wall suggestive of a capsule however this is not seen in the majority of the organism. The Mucicarmine stain is currently pending. No acid fast bacilli are seen on Wade Fite or Ziehl Neelsen stains. No bacterial organisms are seenon the Gram stain. 

The small reactive lymphocytes in the background are composed of a mixture of CD3/CD4 and CD3/CD8 T lymphocytes with no immunoaberrancy. There are small numbers of small CD20 B lymphocytes and only rare plasma cells. No light chain restriction is seen in the small number of plasma cells. HHV8 and EBER-ISH is negative. 

The features are of non necrotizing granulomatous reaction pattern towards fungal organism with intracellular yeast forms. The morphological features are suggestive of Cryptococcus however accurate and definitive fungal organism typing is deferred to further microbiological investigations that have been performed on this specimen.

""""Right axilla core biopsy"""". Two tan cores 15mm each and two fragments up to 2mm. A2. (mk/ss) 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Sections show cores of lymphoid tissue. There is replacement of the normal nodal architecture. There is an infiltrate comprising medium sized lymphocytes with angulated cleaved hyperchromatic nuclei and surrounding clear cytoplasm. There are scattered histiocytes. There are small foci with apoptotic bodies raising the possibility of minor blastoid morphology. Large pleomorphic cells are not seen. The infiltrate is arranged as sheets and focally nodular mantle growth is present. On immunostains, there is confluent staining for CD20. The neoplastic lymphocytes are positive for CD20, BCL2, CD5, Cyclin D1, SOX11 (weak/diffuse, in the presence of weak tissue control) and there is weak expression for BCL6. The atypical lymphocytes are negative for CD3, CD10, CD23, LEF1, Tdt and EBER-ISH. The ki67 proliferation index is 80-90%. There is complete absence of TP53 expression, which is an atypical finding indicating likely underlying genomic aberration and NGS testing has been requested. The features are of mantle cell lymphoma, probably classic type with high cell proliferation although there are focal pockets raising the possibility of blastoid morphology. 


DIAGNOSIS 
Biopsy right axillary core 
- Mantle cell lymphoma, classic type with high cell proliferation (ki67 80-90%), possible minor blastoid morphology. Complete absence of P53 IHC expression, NGS molecular testing has been requested on this sample. ""

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
1-2. Sections show slender, poorly oriented and limited amount of lymphoid tissue. There are scattered reactive appearing compressed germinal centres. The paracortical region comprises small lymphocytes, small numbers of eosinophils, some neutrophils and clusters of epithelioid histiocytes resembling small granulomata. A prominent plasmacytic population is not seen. There is no vascular prominence and no necrosis. On immunostains, there are B cell aggregates which correspond to follicular dendritic cell meshworks (CD21/CD23). There is a mixture of both CD20/PAX5 B lymphocytes and CD3/CD5 T lymphocytes. There is BCL6 and CD10 staining, confined to the germinal centre location and the germinal centers appear negative for BCL2.  The follicular dendritic cell meshworks appear slightly irregular however this maybe artefactual due to oblique sectioning of the tissue fragment. No obvious light chain restriction is identified. Cyclin D1 and EBER-ISH are negative. No organisms are identified on D/PAS, Ziehl Neelsen or Wade Fite stains. 

This is a suboptimal biopsy with very limited material for assessment. The features favour biopsy from a reactive node. There is no obvious lymphoma on current available evidence, however a lymph node excision is recommended if there is a clinical suspicion for lymphoma or a low grade lymphoma.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Sections show two fragments of skin and a large amount of keratinous debris. The deep aspect of both of the skin fragments is partly lined by keratinised squamous epithelium. An inflammatory infiltrate is present within the dermis, composed of small lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes with some cytoplasmic keratin and neutrophils. Immunohistochemistry shows the lymphocytes to be composed predominantly of CD3-positive T cells. The T cells are CD5-positive with loss of CD7 expression. The T cells are mostly CD4-positive,CD8-negative (CD4:CD8 ratio approx. 10:1) . Ki-67 is approximately 10-20%. No granulomatous inflammation is seen to suggest sarcoidosis. 

The skin fragments show an inflamed epidermal cyst, a component of the inflammatory response including cytologically bland lymphocytes with a similar immunohistochemical profile to that identified in the previous skin biopsy (XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX lab number XXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX), probably representing minor infiltration by the patient's known T cell lymphoma.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
1 & 2. Sections show cores of lymphoid tissue. Normal nodal architecture is not appreciated; rather there is a diffuse abnormal infiltrate, with areas of fibrosis. The infiltrate includes an admixture of large atypical lymphoid cells with irregular ovoid nuclei, multiple prominent nucleoli, and a moderate amount of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, admixed with small lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional eosinophils. Plasma cells are not prominent in the infiltrate. There are scattered mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies. Focally, bands of dense hyalinised collagen are seen between neoplastic cells. 

Immunohistochemistry shows that the large atypical lymphoid cells are reactive for CD20, CD30 (patchy), bcl6, bcl-2 and MUM1, and are negative for CD3, CD5, cyclin D1, CD10, CD23, ALK, CD43 and T-BET. C-myc is reactive in approximately 15% of tumour cells, interpreted as a negative result. In-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBER) is negative. The Ki67 index is approximately 60%.

1-2. Sections show cores of tissue in which there is a confluent sheet like lymphoid infiltrate. A small amount of airway wall and ciliated columnar lining is seen. There is fibrosis in a fibrohistiocytic response in the background. Cell size is difficult to assess on the initial H&E section as the lymphoid cells are crushed. The lymphoid infiltrate is small to medium sized, however focal areas show that the cells are probably medium sized to large, with irregular nuclear outlines. These correspond to foci with increased ki67 proliferative activity. On immunostains, there are confluent aggregates of CD20/CD79a/Pax5 expressing B cells. They appear to show lambda light chain expression, express BCL6 (in 50%), weakly for BCL2 (in 20% of the cells) and are negative for CD10 (only 10% of cells showing staining). A smaller population of plasmacytoid cells are seen (CD79a+ with lambda light chain restriction, Pax5-ve). The B cells are negative for CD5, CD23, Cyclin D1, CD10, CD30 and EBER-ISH. Immunohistochemistry for CMYC is negative (staining in 10% of cells). The features are of CD5/CD10 negative B cell lymphoma, most is keeping with marginal zone lymphoma.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Sections show a punch biopsy of skin to deep dermis/superficial subcutis. The epidermis is intact with no involvement by tumour. Occupying the full thickness of the dermis and the biopsy depth is a diffuse infiltrate of large atypical cells, percolating between the interstitial collagen fibres. The tumour cells have enlarged irregular nuclei with variably prominent, sometimes centrally located nucleoli. There are numerous apoptotic bodies and mitoses. Plasma cells are not seen. On immunostains, the tumour cells are positive for CD45 (moderate intensity/diffuse), CD79a (strong diffuse), Pax5(strong diffuse), CD20 (moderate intensity membrane staining, patchy but in >30% of tumour cells) and CD30 (weak/moderate in a substantial proportion of tumour). There is clear expression of BCL2, MYC (>95%, strong). The ki67 proliferation index is >95%. The tumour cells are negative for CD19, MUM1, CD10, BCL6, CD3, CD5, Cyclin D1 and EBER-ISH. There are small numbers of background small T cells highlighted with CD3/CD5. Immunohistochemistry for ALK and CD138 are pending. 

The features are of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, non GC type, ki67 >95%, expressing MYC/BCL2 by IHC. MYC rearrangement has reported previously, without accompanying BCL2 or BCL6 gene rearrangement. FISH testing has not been repeated on this sample.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Sections of lymph node show a lymphocyte depleted pattern, with accentuated hilar and cortical vascularity, some internal fibrosis and focal hyalinisation, and conspicuous loose clusters of histiocytes with finely granular cytoplasm. In areas the histiocytes have a vaguely spindled appearance. There is no evidence of a confluent large cell population. Immunoperoxidase staining shows virtual complete absence of B-lymphocytes. There are scattered positive staining cells (CD20, PAX5 and CD79a) but these are in a striking minority (approximately 1% of cells). The majority of the lymphoid population are T-cells, staining with CD3 and CD5. The Ki-67 proliferative index is low (strong staining in approximately 10% of cells). CD21 shows absence of dendritic meshwork. The spindled histiocytes are CD21 negative but stain positively for CD68. PAS and Ziehl Neelson stains failed to identify cytoplasmic organisms. EBV-ISH shows very occasional single positive cells. CD10 shows occasional loose clusters of positive staining cells, probably residual T-helper cells. 
The past history is noted. There is no evidence of lymphoma in this specimen. These features are more in keeping with post treatment changes.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
1-2. Sections show multiple small cores of disrupted bony trabeculae, with some marrow fibrosis and dispersed markedly crushed, fragile nuclear material. Morphology of the cells and tissue architecture are both hampered by the poor tissue preservation and fragmented nature of the specimen. In the somewhat better preserved areas, there are clusters of small to medium sized cells. On immunostains, these appear to represent aggregated small-medium sized B cells showing expression for CD79a, CD20 with high ki67 index although the corresponding Pax5 is difficult to interpret. There are small numbers of admixed CD3/CD5 T cells in these aggregates. Immunostains for AE1/AE3 and CD30 are negative. 

The morphology alone is not diagnostic of lymphoma however the pattern of predominant B cells in the clusters is suspicious for recurrent B cell lymphoma when interpreted in conjunction with the other findings (clinical, radiological findings and flow cytometry immunophenotyping results).

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 
Multiple levels have been examined. The punch biopsy includes a little subcutaneous fat. The epidermis is intact but shows mild compact hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosos and hyperplasia with mild spongiosis and exocytosis of a few mononuclear cells. In 
the upper dermis, there is a light perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils with moderate amounts of nuclear debris in places. There is no fibrinoid necrosis or fibrin extravasation and no red cell extravasation. 
In immunostains for myeloperoxidase, there are only scattered positive mononuclear cells. No microorganisms are demonstrated in Gram, PAS, Grocott or Z-N stains. 

COMMENT: The perivascular infiltrate contains too few blasts for a leukaemic infiltrate and the features are not those of Sweet's syndrome. The features best fit an urticarial vasculitis or a resolving leucocytoclastic vasculitis so a drug reaction is 
a possible aetiology, but a reaction to sepsis cannot be absolutely excluded.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
The scout section shows a cross section of lymph node. There is partial effacement of the nodal architecture by expansion of the paracortical region. A few compressed reactive follicles are present at the peripheral edges of the lymph node. Within the expanded paracortex there is a polymorphous infiltrate with scattered histiocytes, plasma cells, plasmacytoid cells and eosinophils. There is an associated vascular proliferation. The lymphocytes within the expanded paracortex are small to medium sized and show cytologic atypia with hyperchromatic nuclei, coarse chromatin pattern and cytoplasmic clearing. Small areas of necrosis are seen.  

On immunostains the atypical lymphocytes within the expanded paracortex are positive for CD45, CD3, CD4 with a biphasic pattern seen with CD2,CD5. There is loss of CD7. Some rare occasional atypical lymphocytes are CD4/CD8 coexpressing. The lesional tumour cells appear positive for PD1 but negative for CD10, BCL6.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
1.&2. Sections of the core biopsy show a diffuse effacement of nodal architecture by an atypical lymphoid infiltrate comprising a relatively monomorphic population of small to medium sized lymphocytes with slightly enlarged and irregular nuclei surrounded by pale cytoplasm. Scattered larger cells present in the background that show central nucleoli. Rare large lymphoid cells show small peripheral nucleoli. Mature small lymphocytes are seen in the background. There are no proliferation centres or lymphoid follicles identified on routine staining. There are very few plasma cells or monocytoid cells. Mitotic figures are moderately frequent. 

Immunohistochemistry show a diffuse infiltrate of CD20/PAX5+ atypical B-cells with co-expression of Bcl-6, LMO2, Bcl-2, CD10 (weak), and GCET1 (weak). CD21 demonstrates a single small follicle with an attenuated dendritic network. CD35 is negative. CD23 is expressed in some B-cells without obvious follicular dendritic cell network. The B-cells are negative for CD5, CD43, CD138 and cyclin D1. Kappa and Lambda are non-contributory (only rare plasma cells). CD3/CD5 stains numerous small T-cells. The Ki-67 mitotic index is difficult to assess due to diffuse pattern and T-cells but is estimated to be at least 50% in the B-cells. BCL2 FISH is negative. There is no evidence of large cell transformation. 

DIAGNOSIS 
1, 2. Right axillary lymph node core biopsies: CD10/BCL6-positive CD5-negative small B-cell lymphoma favoured to be follicular lymphoma with a predominantly diffuse pattern, rather than marginal zone lymphoma; see comment. 


Comment: There is a diffuse pattern and a relatively high Ki67 index (at least 50%). However, the frequency of atypical large B-cells does not meet the criteria for large cell transformation, and WHO grade 2 is favoured in this material. Sample error is always possible. 

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 
BCL6 FISH is equivocal, favoured to be negative. 

The histology and flow cytometry from the XXXXXXXX inguinal Bx (XXXXXXXXX) was compared to the current biopsy and some further immunostains were performed. The morphology is reasonably similar (no follicles, no monocytoid or plasmacytoid cells). Both express BCL6, LMO2 and CD23. Neither expresses light chain, CD138 or CD43. There is weak CD10 and GCET1 expression in the current biopsy, with only occasional staining in 0806-2581. Flow also shows some similarities (no light chain expression), but some differences: now CD10-weak and CD19/22-dim, 0806-2581 is CD10-negative and CD19/22-normal. 

On the basis of these findings the tumour in the current biopsy is slightly favoured to be the same as that in the XXXXXXXX inguinal Bx, although this cannot be completely confirmed. The lymphoid molecular panel is to follow on the current biopsy. If variants are detected, molecular profiling may help to define if the inguinal biopsy is the same tumour, perhaps modified/selected by treatment. ""

There is surface ulceration and excoriation in the biopsy from the left back and the residual intact epidermis shows mild atypia of keratinocytes favoured to represent reactive change. Within the superficial dermis is a mild to moderate chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate comprising small lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophils and occasional neutrophils. The lymphocytes show mild cytologic atypia. In both specimens there is exocytosis of the atypical lymphocytes into the overlying epidermis. There is background mild papillary dermal fibrosis. There are occasional larger cells however most of the infiltrate is composed of small lymphocytes. Sheets of large atypical lymphocytes are not identified. No viral cytopathic changes are seen. No fungal elements are identified on the DPAS stain.

There is no vascular proliferation, plasma cell hyperplasia, granulomatous inflammation, necrotic areas or viral cytopathic changes. Occasional reactive germinal centres are also present, although florid follicular hyperplasia as seen previously is not present in the current tissue core. Immunostains show a mixture of both CD20 and CD3 small lymphocytes. There are no expanded or irregular follicular dendritic cell meshworks. Although there appears to be an increase in CD20 staining, this may reflect tissue sampling through the cortical region. There is no co-expression of CD20 with CD5 or Cyclin D1. The small T lymphocytes show normal CD3/CD5 co-expression. AE1/AE3, CMV, HSV1, HSV2 and EBER-ISH are negative. The features on this limited sample favour a reactive process.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Sections show cores of tumour arranged in organoid nests with large areas of geographic necrosis. The tumour cells have angulated hyperchromatic ovoid nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli, fine chromatin pattern and in areas minimal to moderate cytoplasm. At the edges of the tissue core, the tumour cells have characteristic nuclear features of small cell carcinoma with lack of prominent nucleoli, nuclear molding, fragility and crush artefact. There are indistinct cell borders. There are numerous apoptotic bodies and mitotic activity is brisk.  

On immunostains, the tumour cells are positive for Cam5.2 (perinuclear dot positivity), CD56, Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, TTF1, p504s and very focally for PSAP. There are occasional endothelial cells of small vessels surrounding the packeted tumour islands showing focal staining for PSMA (tumour cells themselves are negative for PSMA). The ki67 index is >90%. The tumour cells are negative for CK7, CK20, P40, S100, ERG, PSA, CDX2. 

The morphological features are those of a high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma/ small cell carcinoma. No conventional prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma is identified. The clinical history and radiological findings are noted. The features would favour small cell carcinoma of prostatic origin ( TTF-1 expression can be seen in small cell carcinomas of the prostate or other sites, limiting its utility in distinguishing primary small cell carcinoma of the prostate from a metastasis from the lung)

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Sections show multiple cores of lymphoid tissue. There is significant diathermy and crush artefact, affecting cytomorphologic assessment of the tumour cells. There is smearing of nuclear material between sclerotic tissue. The lymphoid infiltrate has a vaguely nodular configuration. The lesional cells are mixed, comprising small lymphocytes, small-medium sized angulated centrocyte like cells and in some follicles, there is an admixture of large centrocytes (with angulated irregular nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli with surrounding clear cytoplasm) and centroblasts. Accurate centroblast count is difficult. There is no necrosis. 

Immunohistochemistry shows that the atypical lymphoid cells are diffusely positive for CD20, CD10, BCL2, BCL2 and negative for CD5, cyclin D1, CD23, MUM1, MYC and TdT. P53 is largely negative. Although follicles are not clearly appreciated on H&E-stained sections, CD21/CD23 demonstrates small follicular dendritic cell meshworks throughout. The Ki67 index is variable, ranging from 5% to areas amounting to 30-40%. In block 1.2, within crushed tumour, the ki67 index appears elevated (>40%, but accurate proliferation index assessment is not possible as it may be artefactually raised on this crushed material). EBER-ISH is negative. There are moderate to large numbers of reactive T lymphocytes admixed with the tumour. 

The features are of a B cell lymphoma with germinal centre phenotype, with some nodular/follicular growth pattern and dendritic meshworks seen throughout. The features are interpreted as follicular lymphoma, follicular pattern. Accurate grading is however difficult, especially in the distinction between a grade 2 versus grade 3a. Although transformed disease is difficult to exclude, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is less likely given the FDC meshworks throughout and variable ki67 staining.

Left external iliac biopsy - 
- Limited crushed and diathermied tissue. Features favour follicular lymphoma, follicular architecture, grading difficult (grade 2 versus 3a). DLBCL less likely given the presence of FDC meshworks throughout. ""

The lymphocytes are negative for CD3, CD5, CD23, CD43, LEF1, BCL6, CD10, GCET1, LM02, Cyclin D1, Sox11, Tdt, MYC (heterogenous weak staining in 10%). There are small numbers of plasmacytoid/plasmacytic cells which are highlighted with CD138/MUM1.There is possible weak lambda staining in the cells. There are quite irregular expanded follicular dendritic cell meshworks (with CD21/CD23) however no obvious BCL6/CD10 staining is present and this is interpreted as neoplastic lymphoid cells encroaching upon the germinal centres with involution of the germinal centres. P53 is interpreted as negative (heterogenous weak staining in 10-20% of cells). IgD immunohistochemistry is pending. EBER-ISH is negative. The ki67 index is <5% 

The features are of a CD20 small B cell lymphoma which is CD5/CD10 negative. The infiltrate is fairly monotonous with scattered plasmacytoid/plasma cells. There is no necrosis or large cells. The tumour cells are negative for markers typically seen in CLL and negative for germinal center markers, Cyclin D1, Sox11 and Tdt. 

The morphology would raises the possibility of either a marginal zone lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma or lymphoplasmacytic lymphohoma. Given the clinical and molecular findings, this would fit with splenic marginal zone lymphoma.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
The sections show a few fragmented cores of lymphoid tissue. There are aggregated sheets of predominantly medium sized to occasionally larger lymphoid cells. There are some of the clusters of larger cells, and on corresponding immunostains, appear to represent interspersed germinal centres within the tissue cores. There is no obvious vascular proliferation or prominent eosinophilic infiltrate. There is no necrosis. There is a small amount of fat necrosis in the adjacent fatty tissue. 

There is confluent staining with CD79a, CD20, CD19, Pax5 and these cells co-express BCL2, CD5 but are negative for CD3, CD23, CD10, CD38, Cyclin D1, Sox11, LEF1, GCET and LMO2 (the latter two markers appear strong within the germinal centres). There is strong near diffuse expression for TP53. MYC is negative (staining in10-15% of the cells). These B cells appear to surround presumed reactive germinal centers (CD20/BCL6+ with are CD10/BCL2 negative) which correspond to follicular dendritic cell meshworks (CD21/CD23) in the background. The high ki67 index is confined to the presumed reactive germinal centers, with ki67 proliferation index of up to 30% in the interfollicular region. EBER-ISH is negative.

** NOTE: Discrepancies between Request slip (RIGHT) vs pot labels (LEFT) 

1. """"Left groin BX"""". Specimen is received fresh and portions of fresh lymph node are given to Flow Cytometry and NGS Molecular by XX/XX on XXXXXX. A portion of a lymph node (appears to be half of a lymph node) 27x20x19mm with focally adherent fatty tissue up to 10mm. The lymph node has a tan-brown mottled solid cut surface.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Sections of lymph node show effaced architecture, loss of internal and marginal sinuses and lymphocyte spill beyond the nodal capsule. There is a conspicuous vascular pattern throughout the node but no nodularity and no reactive follicles. The lymphoid population is relatively monomorphous, comprising small to medium sized, atypical lymphocytes, in areas, aggregated around small vessels. There are numerous background histiocytes, moderate single cell apoptosis but no confluent necrosis. Eosinophils are inconspicuous. Immunoperoxidase stains are confusing. The lymphoid population comprise almost entirely T cells. B lymphocytes and plasma cells are virtually absent. Certainly there is no evidence of a restricted plasma cell population. Presumably the B-cell depletion at least in part reflects treatment. The T cell subsets are mixed. The atypical cells appear to be either CD8 positive or CD8/CD4 double negative but a significant number express PD-1. Possibly a component of T cells show some loss of CD7 expression but otherwise there appears to be normal expression of pan T markers (CD2, CD3 and CD5). Other follicular T helper markers are negative (CD10 and BCL6). EBER ISH shows no significant staining. The Ki-67 proliferative index is intermediate but consistent throughout the node, approximately 40%. CD30 is negative. The majority of T cells appear to be BF-1 positive. TCR delta is negative but the control staining is suboptimal. CD21 shows a patchy perisinusoidal FDC proliferation. 

The architectural effacement, T cell predominance and cytological atypia with active proliferation, are features suggestive of recurrent T cell lymphoma, but the immunophenotype is confusing and as a consequence, subtyping is problematic. Previous NGS mutation testing results are noted. The current features are not diagnostic of lymphoma of follicular T helper type. Molecular testing has been requested on the current sample.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 

In both cores, there are large areas of fibrosis, one 8mm in maximum dimension and the other 4mm in maximum dimension. A little liver parenchyma is present at one end of each biopsy.  

In the fibrous tissue, there is a proliferation of fibroblasts and a light infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes with a few entrapped hepatocytes and occasional bile ductules and vessels. There are numerous haemosiderin laden macrophages, some foamy 
macrophages and macrophages containing lipofuscin. Neutrophils are not seen. The fibrosis blends into the adjacent liver which appears to retain normal architecture. Portal tracts in the adjacent liver are normal and inflammation is minimal. Liver 
cell plates are not thickened but some hepatocytes are atrophic. There is a large amount of haemosiderin in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and in Kupffer cells, grade 3. Macrophages and Kupffer cells also contain lipofuscin. There is no evidence of 
malignancy and no active inflammation.

""""R Prs neck"""". Received fresh and not split (XX/XX). Formalin added by XX at 11:13 hours, XXXX. Two pale and fatty cores 12 and 13mm. A2. (mv:oze) 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Sections show two very slender, disrupted cores of lymph node tissue. There are areas of parenchymal fibrosis and fibrosis is also seen in the perinodal adipose tissue, presumably from the previous FNA procedure. Much of the cores contain fibroadipose tissue, and there is only a small amount of lymphoid tissue that has been sampled for assessment. The small amount of lymphoid tissue contains primary follicles and sampling of the interfollicular region. The lymphocytes are small, with only rare eosinophils. Hodgkin-like cells or large atypical lymphoid cells are not present. There is no neutrophilic infiltrate, plasmacytosis, vascular proliferation, necrosis or granulomatous inflammation. On immunostains, the normal immunoarchitecture is present. There are rare small-medium weak CD30 staining cells, interpreted as staining of reactive cells. CD20 small B cells correspond to follicular dendritic meshworks and the intervening region is composed of small CD3/CD5 T lymphocytes. 

The features on this limited sample favour sampling of a reactive lymph node. Only a small amount of lymph node tissue is profiled and this is probably a suboptimal specimen for assessment of possible Hodgkin Lymphoma. A more representative biopsy or a lymph node excision should considered if there is a high clinical suspicion of an underlying lymphoproliferative disease.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
1&2. Sections of the core biopsies show sheets of lymphocytes with a few fibrotic bands, some small nodular aggregates of mixed centrocytes and centroblasts, and scattered eosinophils. A capsule is not seen. Granulomas or necrosis are not seen. The lymphocytes are predominantly small with some medium sizes and also some foci of rare large atypical lymphocytes with poly-lobed/multiple nuclei. In immunostains these large lymphocytes are B-cells expressing CD20, CD45, BOB1, OCT2, PAX5, MUM1, BCL6, BCL2 and CD30. Some weakly express CD10. Most express Ki67. They are negative for CD3, CD5, CD15 and EMA. Some may express CD23. They are surrounded by rings of small CD3/CD4/CD5/PD1-expressing small T-cells. The nodules are somewhat distorted CD21/23+ follicular dendritic cell networks containing CD6/CD10+, BCL2- B-cells surrounded by CD20/CD23+, BCL6/CD10- B-cell mantles. These are favoured to be reactive and the distortion may in part be biopsy artefact. Between the nodules are sheets of small CD3/5+ T-cells lacking atypia. No evidence of carcinoma is seen H&E or in immunostains for AE1/AE3. 

Seen with Dr XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. 

DIAGNOSIS 
1&2. R inguinal lymph node - Atypical lymphoid proliferation; no evidence of metastatic carcinoma; please see comment. 


Comment - There are very small foci in which there are morphologically atypical large B-cells. Most of the lymphoid parenchyma appears somewhat distorted but reactive in nature. Based on this I am unable to make a diagnosis - a benign process such as progressive transformation of germinal centres is possible, but lymphoma (e.g. nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma) cannot be completely excluded. If the node is persistently enlarged or otherwise of concern then excisional biopsy is strongly recommended. ""

""""Left level 2 cervical lymph node"""": Two cores of tan tissue 6mm and 10mm. All submitted in 1.1. A1. (EC) 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: 

Sections show core fragments composed of sheets of lymphoid cells with no intact lymph node architecture identified. There is a mixture of small, medium, and large immunoblast-like cells, with occasional plasmacytoid cells. The predominant population 
consists of medium sized cells with oval to irregular notched nuclei, inconspicuous nuclei and moderate amounts of clear cytoplasm. There is abundant cell apoptosis and focal necrosis. No polymorphs are identified.  

On immunohistochemistry CD20 highlights about half of the medium sized and larger cells, mostly dispersed with somesmall sheet like areas. PAX5 stains fewer cells. MUM1 is expressed in the majority of medium and larger cells. Cd138 is expressed on a 
minority of medium and larger cells.Cd3 and Cd5 are expressed in dispersed small lymphocytes. Cd10 and BCL-2 are essentially negative. BCL-6 marks a minority of larger cells.   Cd30 marks scattered medium and larger cells. Cd68 marks moderate 
numbers of scattered cells. Myeloperoxidase and C-KIT are essentially negative. Epstein Barr virus LMP immunohistochemistry is focally positive, and Epstein Barr virus ISH is positive in the majority of cells. Kappa and Lambda ISH shows Lambda light 
chain restriction. The Ki67 index appears approximately 90%.  

DIAGNOSIS: 

Level level 2 cervical lymph node biopsy: Polymorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

There is minimal liver parenchyma available for examination. No central veins are identified and thus veno occlusive disease cannot be excluded. There are only two portal tracts present however these portal tracts are unremarkable and thus no evidence 
of vanishing duct disease or graft vs host disease is identified. However it should be noted that there is limited tissue available for examination. In this setting he most likely cause for the cholestasis is a drug reaction 
However please note there is minimal diagnostic tissue and thus the other proposed diagnoses cannot be excluded.. Clinicopathological correlation is required.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
Two cytospins slides are available for assessment. One of the slides is essentially acellular. The other slide shows substantial red cell contamination, extensive mature lymphocytosis, and moderate numbers of monocytes. Very rare atypical mononuclear cells are seen, but overtly large pleomorphic cells are not present. The peripheral blood smear does not show this lymphocytosis. The corresponding flow cytometry sample is relatively paucicellular, and given the features seen on the cellular cytospin slide, it is suspected that the flow cytometry may not be truly representative of the specimen. Overall, this is interpreted as lymphocytosis, presumed reactive however due to the discrepancy in cellularity between the cytospin preparation and flow findings, a repeat sample should be considered if clinically indicated. 

OPINION 
CSF cytology 
- Lymphocytosis, presumed reactive (see report)

(HR XXXXXXXXXXX) 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
1. The specimen contains mainly alveolar macrophages and rare bronchial epithelial cells. There are very rare cells with vacuolated cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli, present singly and in small clusters. Given the history of recent neutropenic sepsis , radiologic findings of recent pneumonia and rhinovirus infection, the features are interpreted as most likely representing reactive type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. The cells of type II pneumocyte hyperplasia may be florid, resembling those of an adenocarcinoma, however the clinical setting in this case supports a diagnosis of reactive change. Sequential or repeat negative specimens after the acute respiratory event may be helpful. No fungal elements are identified on the Grocott methanamine silver stain. 

2: The bronchial washings contain stripped reactive bronchial epithelial cells together with pulmonary macrophages. No fungal elements are identified on the Grocott methanamine silver stain. 

OPINION 
1. Bronchial alveolar lavage right lung 
- Scant atypical cells, favoured to represent reactive type II pneumocyte hyperplasia in view of the history of recent infective episode. 

2. Bronchial washings right lung 
- No malignant cells identified
