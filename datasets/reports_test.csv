1-3. Sections show similar features and are described together. They show lymph node core biopsies with effacement of the normal architecture by sheets of atypical large lymphoid cells. There is marked nuclear atypia, single to multiple prominent nucleoli, and frequent atypical mitoses. The sheets of large atypical lymphocytes cells are positive for CD20, PAX5 and show co-expression for BCL2, BCL6 (weak, 40% of cells), MUM1 (strong, 90% of cells) and are negative for CD10. C-myc is interpreted as being positive (weak to moderate, 70-80% of cells). The large atypical lymphocytes are positive for Cyclin D1, P53(strong diffuse 100% of cells), LEF1, CD5 (weak) and negative for Sox11. The ki67 is 90-100%. EBER-ISH is negative. 

Very focally at the edge of the large B cell component is an area composed of relatively monotonous population of small lymphocytes and possibly resembling a proliferation center. This population of small B lymphocytes are positive for CD20, CD5 (strong), LEF1, Cyclin D1 (patchy) and negative for CD3, Sox11. 

The features are of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, Non GC/ABC phenotype, co-expressor status positive. There is aberrant expression of Cyclin D1 and Sox11 is negative. There is a focal background component with immunophenotype resembling CLL/SLL. The features are consistent with Richter's transformation of CLL/SLL.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
""""Left groin lymph node"""". Specimen is received fresh and small portions of lymph nodes are submitted fresh to flow cytometry and molecular by XX/XX on XXXXXXXXX. Three lymph nodes 12-25mm with diffuse adherent fibrofatty tissue up to 20mm. The largest node has a tan-white softened cut surface (possible necrosis). The remaining two lymph nodes are focally tan and firm; distinct positive areas not identified. 1.1 and 1.2: One lymph node TSx4. 1.3 and 1.4: One node, TSx5. 1.5-1.8: One node, TSx8. P8 (nodes entirely submitted). (mk:oze) 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
The largest node described macroscopically is necrotic. The smaller nodes, particularly in blocks 1.3 and 1.4, are well preserved and orientated. There is effaced architecture, increased vascularity and a relatively monomorphous population of mildly enlarged and atypical cells with cleaved nuclei. There is no nodularity and no evidence of a confluent large cell population. Immunoperoxidase staining shows very small numbers of single B-cells. The atypical small cell population stain with CD2, CD3, CD5 and BF-1. CD7 stains the majority of these cells but there is a minor component showing loss of expression. CD8 is negative and CD4 appears to stain background macrophages only. Atypical lymphocytes are negative. CD10, TdT, BCL6 and CD30 are also negative. The Ki-67 proliferative index is approximately 50%. EBER-ISH identifies scattered single positive cells. 
This represents a diffuse, atypical, aberrant T-cell proliferation. The past history is noted. The features are interpreted as recurrent peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS.

3. """"R post thigh"""". A punch biopsy 3x3x5mm. A1. (cs/kr) 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
1. Sections of the punch biopsy of skin show a moderately dense perivascular and interstitial infiltrate, extending through superficial and deep dermis and into superficial subcutis. The infiltrate is composed predominantly of lymphocytes, ranging from small to large in size, but predominantly small to medium sized, with admixed histiocytes, some epithelioid in appearance, and plasma cells. The infiltrate shows some epidermotropism, with lymphocytes present singly and in small clusters, predominantly along the basal layer of the epidermis, with associated mild spongiosis. There is also mild hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis, and occasional apoptotic keratinocytes are seen. Immunohistochemical stains show a predominance of CD3-positive T-cells, with some loss of expression of CD7, but normal expression of CD2 and CD5. The majority are CD4-positive, with CD8 staining only occasional small lymphocytes. BetaF1 stains only rare T-cells, but PD-1 is positive in a significant population. Immunostains for kappa and lambda light chains show probably lambda light chain restriction. In-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBER) shows positive staining in a subpopulation of cells present. 

The appearances are of a T-cell rich infiltrate, without definite cytological atypia or immunophenotypic aberrancy, but, in the context of the previous history, are suspicious for cutaneous involvement by angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. The presence of a B-cell/plasmacytic infiltrate with probable lambda light chain restriction, presumably represents an associated B-cell proliferation, possibly EBV-related. IgH and TCR gene rearrangement studies will be performed, and a separate report issued, and the sections reviewed with Dr XXXXXXX. 
 
2&3. Sections of the punch biopsies of skin show a moderately dense interstitial and perivascular infiltrate within upper dermis, with perivascular and periadnexal extension through dermis and into subcutaneous fat. The infiltrate is again composed predominantly of lymphocytes, predominantly small to intermediate is size. There is more pronounced epidermotropism, and there is some thickening of collagen bundles within upper dermis. Epithelioid histiocytes are not prominent, but there are plasma cells and occasional eosinophils in the dermal infiltrate. Immunohistochemical stains show a CD3-positive, T-cell-predominant infiltrate, with only rare CD20-positive B-cells. There is loss of expression of CD7, but retained expression of CD2 and CD5. The majority of cells in the dermis are CD4-positive and CD8-negative, but the epidermotropic component of the infiltrate shows a predominance of CD8-positive cells, with smaller numbers of CD4-positive cells. 

The appearances are of a T-cell rich infiltrate, with some similarity to that seen in specimen 1, but with an additional CD8-positive epidermotropic component. The differential diagnosis includes cutaneous involvement by angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, as well as other forms of T-cell lymphoma or a drug reaction. TCR gene rearrangement studies will be performed, and a separate report issued, and the sections reviewed with Dr XXXXXXX. 

DIAGNOSIS 
1. Skin from left deltoid, punch biopsy - T-cell rich infiltrate, in context suspicious for cutaneous involvement by angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, with an associated lambda-predominant B-cell/plasmacytic infiltrate; supplementary report to follow.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
1,2. Sections show effacement of nodal architecture by a population of small atypical lymphocytes with a follicular architecture. The neoplastic follicles are mostly uniform in size, composed atypical lymphoid cells comprising an irregular admixture of mostly small cleaved centrocytes and to a lesser extent centroblasts. The follicular proportion of the biopsy is >75% with only rare centroblasts detected in the interfollicular zone. Neoplastic follicles contain up to 4 centroblasts per high power field. No blastoid features are seen and there is no evidence of high grade transformation. 

Immunohistochemistry with CD20 and PAX5 shows an abnormal immunoarchitecture. CD20 and PAX5 show neoplastic follicles composed of malignant B cells with co-expression of Bcl-6, CD10 and Bcl-2 (SP66) with extension into the interfollicular zone. CD21 and CD23 demonstrate attenuation and disruption of the follicular dendritic network within neoplastic follicles. There is no CD5 co-expression and moderate numbers of reactive CD3/CD5 + T cells are observed within the interfollicular zones. Cyclin D1 and CD138 are negative. Kappa and lambda confirm a monotypic B cell population with lambda light chain restriction. The Ki-67 mitotic index in neoplastic follicles is estimated to be 10-20%. 

The concurrent flow cytometry demonstrates a clonal B-cell population with lambda light chain restriction and an immunophenotype typical of CD10+ follicular lymphoma (see full report). 

Together, the morphology, immunophenotype and concurrent flow cytometry are consistent with Follicular lymphoma, follicular pattern (>75%), WHO grades 1-2.

DIAGNOSIS 
Skin punch biopsy, unlabelled to sit (presumed dorsum L hand) - Intraepidermal pustule and mild squamous atypia. 

Comment - An acantholytic mildly dysplastic actinic keratosis with secondary pustule development due to infection is favoured, although a primary pustular disorder with reactive squamous atypia cannot be completely excluded. There is no evidence of squamous cell carcinoma in this small biopsy, although if this is the clinical impression then a larger biopsy is recommended. ""

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
1. The lymph nodes are all abnormal. The lymphoid compartment is atrophic. There is an accumulation of histiocytes in paracortex with some sclerosis and minor perinodal fibrosis. Portions of some nodes are relatively sparsely cellular. There are however, preserved atypical single cells, most evident in blocks 1.1 and 1.4. These cells are large with polylobated nuclei and prominent macro nucleoli, and abundant pale or vacuolated cytoplasm. The node in block 1.3 is more cellular, comprising a light mixed population of B- and T-lymphocytes and numerous histiocytes, staining with CD68 and CD163. The T-cells show normal CD2, CD3, CD5 and CD7 expression and mixed CD4 and CD8 subsets. There is no follicular dendritic proliferation. PD-1 stains a relatively sparse population, probably BCL6 positive but CD10 negative. Ki-67 shows low proliferative activity in paracortex (< 5%). There are small numbers of polyclonal plasma cells. In summary, there is no evidence of an atypical, proliferating or aberrant T-cell population to indicate T-cell lymphoma. 
With regards the atypical single cells, staining was performed on block 1.1. These cells are PAX5, CD30, CD15 and EBER-ISH positive but stain negatively for CD20 and CD3. 

2. Sections show unremarkable voluntary muscle. There is some fresh interstitial haemorrhage but no inflammation or active muscle damage and no evidence of neoplasia.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
1. """"Lymph node right groin"""". Specimen received fresh and sampled for Flow Cytometry and Micro on XXXXXXX by XX. A lymph node 16x10x9mm with attached adipose tissue up to 3mm. The cut surface is diffusely tan-grey slightly congested. TSx5. A2. 
2. """"Lymph node right groin"""". A ragged lymph node 32x13x8mm with attached adipose tissue up to 3mm. The cut surface is tan-grey haemorrhagic. TSx13. A3. (cs:oze) 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 
1&2. Sections of lymph node show effaced architecture and a diffuse infiltrate of plump macrophages and small mature lymphocytes, with interspersed single large atypical cells displaying prominent nucleoli and coarse chromatin, in areas loosely aggregated, and some single apoptotic cells. Eosinophils and plasma cell are infrequent. There is no nodularity. Marginal sinus is largely preserved but internal sinuses are absent. There is partial preservation of lymph node in areas, and minor spill beyond nodal capsule. There are no confluent sheets of large cells although the tumour cells are more numerous in areas (eg block 2.2). Immunoperoxidase staining shows the large atypical cells are CD20/PAX5 positive, negative for T-cell markers, CD30, CD15 and EBER-ISH. The background T-cells are positive for CD2, CD3, CD5 and CD7. Allowing for histiocytic staining, the CD4 to CD8 ratio is approximately 1:1. CD21 shows no FDC proliferation. The large cells are Ki-67 active but there is also moderate activity in the background lymphohistiocytic population. PCR for TCR and IgH has been requested in an attempt to confirm the impression of a minority neoplastic B-cell population. 

DIAGNOSIS 
1&2: Lymph node excision right groin- features most in keeping with T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma. M96883.""
